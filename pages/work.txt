//inc.Writing - to address: what does she do on her own

Roselyn began her writing career as a journalist. She wrote columns, feature articles and reviews for newspapers, magazines and web outlets. From there, she began writing and adapting plays, and that led to her writing digital content. Roselyn starts a project with a driving question about human nature - why do we do what we do? That exploration propels the story. Roselyn is now developing two series, one for the web and one for TV. Go to [[http://roselyn.ca/#next "Now&Next"]] for details.
