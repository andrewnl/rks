//inc.Creative Work - to address: what does she do on her own?

Roselyn began her writing career as a journalist. She wrote columns, feature articles and reviews for newspapers, magazines and web outlets, as well as chase-producing for CTV News. Roselyn then moved into writing and adapting plays, which she still loves to do. She starts a project with a driving question about human nature - why we do what we do, and that is the exploration that propels the story. Roselyn is now developing two series, to one for the web and one for TV. Go to Now&Next for details.
