The women of Roselyn's work go through crises and become their most resilient selves. Roselyn explores the human condition, particularly for women of colour. What makes a woman strong? brave? compassionate? These explorations drive the stories that Roselyn tells, on stage and screen. 

Roselyn began her writing career as a journalist. She wrote columns, feature articles and reviews for newspapers, magazines and web outlets. From there, she did a 3-year apprenticeship as a playwright, theatre-deviser & actor, at b current.

She began writing and adapting plays, and that led to her writing content for the screen. Roselyn starts a project with a driving question about human nature - why do we do what we do? That exploration propels the story. Go to [[http://roselyn.ca/#next "Now&Next"]] for details on what Roselyn has in development. 

Roselyn is a contributor to many web outlets including the women's empowerment zine, [[https://www.bitchesbewitches.com/stories/2017/10/5/an-over-achiever-on-shame-climbing-out?rq=roselyn Bitches be Witches]] and the [[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/first-person/article-my-concussion-is-the-best-thing-thats-happened-to-me/ Globe & Mail]].
