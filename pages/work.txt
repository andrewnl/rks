Roselyn writes for stage and screen. Using her background in [[http://roselyn.ca/law law,]] she brings a wide breadth of experience to her works, exploring the human struggle for women of colour. 

_Sister Warriors_ is about sisterhood and crisis of faith. When young Rhania is bride-napped, Eyaliya gives up everything to rescue her. Bride-napping is the practice of abducting and forcing girls into marriage. Eyaliya’s ambition to live in a monastic community is derailed when Rhania is abducted. To rescue her, Eyaliya has to face her doubts about God and decide what human life is worth. Dharini, the sister of Rhania’s abductor, tries to help Rhania to cope. Even the abductorhusband Angelo is doing what he thinks is his duty to uphold his family legacy. In a world where sex crimes are tradition, everyone is bound by the system, even those who seem to hold power. NOT appropriate for children.

The women of Roselyn's work go through crises and become their most resilient selves. Roselyn explores the human condition, particularly for women of colour. What makes a woman strong? brave? compassionate? These explorations drive the stories that Roselyn tells, on stage and screen. 

Roselyn began her writing career as a journalist. She wrote columns, feature articles and reviews for newspapers, magazines and web outlets. From there, she did a 3-year apprenticeship as a playwright, theatre-deviser & actor, at b current.

She began writing and adapting plays, and that led to her writing content for the screen. Roselyn starts a project with a driving question about human nature - why do we do what we do? That exploration propels the story. Go to [[http://roselyn.ca/#next "Now&Next"]] for details on what Roselyn has in development. 

Roselyn is a contributor to many web outlets including the women's empowerment zine, [[https://www.bitchesbewitches.com/stories/2017/10/5/an-over-achiever-on-shame-climbing-out?rq=roselyn Bitches be Witches]] and the [[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/first-person/article-my-concussion-is-the-best-thing-thats-happened-to-me/ Globe & Mail]].
