Roselyn began her writing career as a journalist. She wrote columns, feature articles and reviews for newspapers, magazines and web outlets, as well as chase-produced TV News. Roselyn then moved into writing and adapting plays, which she still loves to do. She starts a project with a driving question about human nature - why do we do what we do? That exploration propels the story. Roselyn is now developing two series, one for the web and one for TV. Go to Now&Next for details.
