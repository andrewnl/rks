Roselyn got to voice three episodes and four characters on the thoughtful children's series, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8jSnuI0E8B4fWY4HckSTZw?&ab_channel=Rick%26Ricky "Rick & Ricky"]]. Between playing a struggling mom, a sunny 10-year-old girl, a grieving woman over 80, and kind-hearted 12-year old boy, Roselyn had a blast discovering each character! She recently completed Canada's National Voice Intensive, for the second time, with internationally renown speech and dialect coach, David Smukler.
