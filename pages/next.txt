.._Theatre_
Roselyn is thrilled to play two dream roles with [[http://spurofthemomentshakespeare.weebly.com "Spur-of-the-Moment Shakespeare."]] this season. Roselyn plays Katherine (The Taming of the Shrew) in a new, original Shakespeare mash-up where Prince Hal has to become a better person in order to become king. To do that, he decides to make Katherine his mission project. Roselyn also plays Juliet in an excerpt of Romeo & Juliet, and she couldn't be happier! 

Roselyn recently finished a comedic turn, playing Cleopatra. (Figure that one out!) In _Macbeth's Head_, a new comedy by Kyle McDonald, Cleopatra teams up with Maccers & Richard III to make Shakespeare fix their tragic ends. Stay tuned for the future of this Cleopatra [[http://www.malfiproductions.com/macbeths-head at Malfi Productions]].
