About: _Sister Warriors_ is an action-for-stageplay exposing bride-napping in the world today. In this quick-paced, action-packed drama, women warriors lead the exploration of sisterhood and faith and trauma that happens every day. _Sister Warriors_ kicks off when young Rhania is bride-napped, and her half-sister rescues her. Everyone confronts who they are in crisis in a world where sex crimes are tradition, and everyone is bound by the system, even those who seem to hold power. Witness the first workshop for this new, highly physical play, all online.

“Vancouver-based Affair of Honor describes itself as a “fight and movement-based theatre and performance company,” and these actors have serious skills — fencing, sparring and wrestling around the stage convincingly during their numerous conflicts. As smooth as the fight choreography is, the production is equally committed to strong acting, along with a bold message about society’s expectations of women.” – Janet French, Edmonton Journal

.._Writing for Theatre_
Roselyn is the Playwright in Residence at [[https://suitcaseinpoint.com Suitcase in Point Theatre]] (St. Catharines, ON), creating new work and mentoring their Nest of emerging artists.
//Roselyn is grateful that the tour of her play, "Never in the Room," completed its tour of southern Ontario before the outbreak. Her first forum theatre script, the play was developed with [[http://www.mixedcompanytheatre.com/ Mixed Company Theatre]] (Toronto, ON). "Never in the Room" explores the experience of a Bangladeshi woman fights the incremental confiscation of her power to make decisions in her own life as she ages. 

//In partnership with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]], Roselyn is seeking a co-presenter for SISTER WARRIORS, a play about sisterhood, bride-napping and crisis of faith. The play is commissioned by the theatre company, [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]] (Vancouver, BC), who specialize in movement-driven theatre about badass women warriors. 

//Roselyn is also writing a play, set in early twentieth century Egypt, about how a woman learns to heal her heart through losing two loves of her life. How does a woman change how she deals with grief? From someone who recedes from love to someone who can love out and keep on living. 

.._Acting for Film/TV_
//Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

//Roselyn has a short film, "Llorona", in consideration for film festivals. Roselyn plays a single mom trying to teach her child love instead of fear of the ghost stories from their heritage. 
//The first season of a new series, "In The Dark", is currently airing, and Roselyn had a role in the pilot. Directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury,[[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer. 

Next, Roselyn is looking forward to her first feature film role AND two webseries roles. Stay tuned for updates as production rolls forward! For her news & thoughts, join the facebook group:  [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/sixandeight/ Roselyn, Actor & Storyteller]].  

.._Writing for Film & TV_
