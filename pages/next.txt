//We had some illuminating discussion following the livestream workshop presentation with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]]. Now, we're looking toward developing with SiP's [[https://www.facebook.com/InTheSoilFest IN THE SOIL Multi-Arts Festival]] summer 2021. 
 
//_Sister Warriors_ is an action-for-stageplay exposing bride-napping in the world today. In this quick-paced, action-packed drama, women warriors lead the exploration of sisterhood and faith and trauma that happens every day. _Sister Warriors_ kicks off when young Rhania is bride-napped, and her half-sister rescues her. Everyone confronts who they are in crisis in a world where sex crimes are tradition, and everyone is bound by the system, even those who seem to hold power. Witness the first workshop for this new, highly physical play, all online.

.._Acting for Film/TV_
//Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

//Roselyn has a short film, "Llorona", in consideration for film festivals. Roselyn plays a single mom trying to teach her child love instead of fear of the ghost stories from their heritage. 
//The first season of a new series, "In The Dark", is currently airing, and Roselyn had a role in the pilot. Directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury,[[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer.
