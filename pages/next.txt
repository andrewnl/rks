.._Writing for Theatre_
Roselyn is the Playwright in Residence at [[https://suitcaseinpoint.com Suitcase in Point Theatre]] (St. Catharines, ON), creating new work and mentoring their Nest of emerging artists.
//Roselyn is grateful that the tour of her play, "Never in the Room," completed its tour of southern Ontario before the outbreak. Her first forum theatre script, the play was developed with [[http://www.mixedcompanytheatre.com/ Mixed Company Theatre]] (Toronto, ON). "Never in the Room" explores the experience of a Bangladeshi woman fights the incremental confiscation of her power to make decisions in her own life as she ages. 

In partnership with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]], Roselyn is seeking a co-presenter for SISTER WARRIORS, a play about sisterhood, bride-napping and crisis of faith. The play is commissioned by the theatre company, [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]] (Vancouver, BC), who specialize in movement-driven theatre about badass women warriors. 

//Roselyn is also writing a play, set in early twentieth century Egypt, about how a woman learns to heal her heart through losing two loves of her life. How does a woman change how she deals with grief? From someone who recedes from love to someone who can love out and keep on living. 


.._Acting for Film/TV_
//Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

Roselyn has a short film, "Llorona", in consideration for film festivals. Roselyn plays a single mom trying to teach her child love instead of fear of the ghost stories from their heritage. 
//The first season of a new series, "In The Dark", is currently airing, and Roselyn had a role in the pilot. Directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury,[[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer. 

Next, Roselyn is looking forward to a recurring role in a network series. For her news & thoughts, join the facebook group:  [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/sixandeight/ Roselyn, Actor & Storyteller]].

Roselyn is preparing to write and direct a documentary, [[http://www.ectheatre.ca/get-involved/auditions/ "Senior Stories of Resilience"]].

Fail Better is a half-hour episodic dramedy following Tegan, an articling student with a crippling fear of failure, that drives her through a cutthroat apprenticeship in a Mississauga law firm.
//It's about Tegan, a woman who is so afraid of failure that every decision becomes monumentally difficult during her first lawyer-in-training job at a Toronto law firm. The series follows Tegan in that terrifying feeling of, what if I drop it all?
