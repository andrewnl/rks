//.._Sister Warriors | Theatre in Development_

//<div>[[Sister_Warriors-stageplay_2.png]]</div>

//We had some illuminating discussion following the livestream workshop presentation with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]]. Roselyn is developing a new play with Suitcase in Point's [[https://inthesoil.on.ca/artists-events/2022/roselyn-kelada-sedra-with-affair-of-honor IN THE SOIL Multi-Arts Festival]] spring 2022. 
 
//_Sister Warriors_ is about sisters dealing with bride-napping when it happens in their families. When young Rhania is bride-napped, Eyaliya gives up everything to rescue her. Bride-napping is the practice of abducting and forcing girls into marriage. Eyaliya’s ambition to live in a monastic community is derailed when Rhania is abducted. To rescue her, Eyaliya has to face her doubts about God and decide what human life is worth. Dharini, the sister of Rhania’s abductor, tries to help Rhania to cope. Even the abductor-husband Angelo is doing what he thinks is his duty to uphold his family legacy. In a world where sex crimes are tradition, everyone is bound, even those who seem to hold power. NOT appropriate for children.

.._Acting for Film/TV_
Roselyn is thrilled to be part of a ground-breaking new Showtime series with an A-list team.
//Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

//Roselyn has a short film, "Llorona", in consideration for film festivals. Roselyn plays a single mom trying to teach her child love instead of fear of the ghost stories from their heritage. 
//The first season of a new series, "In The Dark", is currently airing, and Roselyn had a role in the pilot. Directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury,[[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer.
