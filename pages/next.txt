.._Theatre_
Roselyn is thrilled to be playing TWO of her dream roles with [[http://spurofthemomentshakespeare.weebly.com "Spur-of-the-Moment Shakespeare."]] this season. Roselyn plays Katherine (The Taming of the Shrew) in a new, original Shakespeare mashu-up where Prince Hal has to become a better person in order to become king. To do that, he decides to make Katherine his mission project. Roselyn also plays Juliet in an excerpt of Romeo & Juliet, and she couldn't be happier! 

Roselyn recently finished a comedic turn, playing Cleopatra. (Figure that one out!) In _Macbeth's Head_, a new comedy by Kyle McDonald, Cleopatra teams up with Maccers & Richard III to make Shakespeare fix their tragic ends. Stay tuned for the future of this Cleopatra [[http://www.malfiproductions.com/macbeths-head at Malfi Productions]].

.._Writing_
With Livia Berius, Roselyn is co-writing a series, _Raising the Bar_. It's is about Tegan, a woman of colour living as an articling student and an actress â€“ and her struggle, looking like a success and feeling like a failure.
It's a dramedy that digs into the misogyny and racial prejudices in the legal profession and the acting industry in Toronto. Think [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1qYxOF7TUs "Insecure"]] meets [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1742650/ "I don't know how she does it"]].  

Roselyn's dream roles include Cleopatra in Shakespeare's _Antony & Cleopatra_, Helena in _All's Well That Ends Well_ and Hermione in _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_... obviously.
