//.._Sister Warriors | Theatre in Development_

//<div>[[Sister_Warriors-stageplay_2.png]]</div>

//We had some illuminating discussion following the livestream workshop presentation with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]]. Roselyn is developing a new play with Suitcase in Point's [[https://inthesoil.on.ca/artists-events/2022/roselyn-kelada-sedra-with-affair-of-honor IN THE SOIL Multi-Arts Festival]] spring 2022. 
 
//_Sister Warriors_ is about sisters dealing with bride-napping when it happens in their families. When young Rhania is bride-napped, Eyaliya gives up everything to rescue her. Bride-napping is the practice of abducting and forcing girls into marriage. Eyaliya’s ambition to live in a monastic community is derailed when Rhania is abducted. To rescue her, Eyaliya has to face her doubts about God and decide what human life is worth. Dharini, the sister of Rhania’s abductor, tries to help Rhania to cope. Even the abductor-husband Angelo is doing what he thinks is his duty to uphold his family legacy. In a world where sex crimes are tradition, everyone is bound, even those who seem to hold power. NOT appropriate for children.

Roselyn has completed residencies [[https://patthedog.org/the-womens-room/ Writers' Room at Pat the Dog Theatre]] (Kitchener-Waterloo, ON) & [[https://suitcaseinpoint.com Suitcase in Point]]. Roselyn is seeking a production parter for _Sister Warriors_ and an international residency host.
//Roselyn is grateful that the tour of her play, "Never in the Room," completed its tour of southern Ontario before the outbreak. Her first forum theatre script, the play was developed with [[http://www.mixedcompanytheatre.com/ Mixed Company Theatre]] (Toronto, ON). "Never in the Room" explores the experience of a Bangladeshi woman fights the incremental confiscation of her power to make decisions in her own life as she ages. 

//In partnership with [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]], Roselyn is workshopping SISTER WARRIORS, a play about sisterhood, bride-napping and crisis of faith. The play is being presented [[https://inthesoil.on.ca/ July 9-10, 2022 as a staged reading in the In The Soil Multi-Arts Festival]]. Its development is supported by [[https://suitcaseinpoint.com/ Suitcase in Point Theatre]] (St. Catharines, ON) & [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]] (Vancouver, BC), who specialize in movement-driven theatre about badass women warriors. 

//Roselyn is also writing a play, set in early twentieth century Egypt, about how a woman learns to heal her heart through losing two loves of her life. How does a woman change how she deals with grief? From someone who recedes from love to someone who can love out and keep on living. 

.._Writing for Film & TV_

.._Acting for Film/TV_
//Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

//Roselyn has a short film, "Llorona", in consideration for film festivals. Roselyn plays a single mom trying to teach her child love instead of fear of the ghost stories from their heritage. 
//The first season of a new series, "In The Dark", is currently airing, and Roselyn had a role in the pilot. Directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury,[[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer.
