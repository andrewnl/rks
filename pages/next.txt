.._Film/TV_
Roselyn is exploring her heritage as a woman of colour and what it takes for women of colour manoeuvering male-dominated professional environments. What's at the bottom of the experience of women who walk with strength, deep hearts and intelligence? 

Look out for Roselyn in the pilot episode of "In The Dark", airing on April 4th on CBS, directed by Michael Showalter and written by Corinne Kingsbury. [[https://news.otakukart.com/420111/in-the-dark-cw-release-date-2019/ "In the Dark"]] is about a blind woman who is the only witness to the murder of her drug-dealer friend. Police dismiss her, so she sets out to find her friend's killer. 

Next, Roselyn is looking forward to a recurring role in a network series. For her news & thoughts, join the facebook group:  [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/sixandeight/ Roselyn, Actor & Storyteller]].  

.._Writing_
Roselyn is writing a play about bridenapping and how two sisters fight through it happening to them in "Sister Warriors." Commissioned by [[https://www.facebook.com/AffairofHonorFighters/ Affair of Honor]], Roselyn is excited to develop this piece for a workshop and production in summer 2019 in Vancouver and Edmonton. 

Roselyn is creating strong, complex female leads in [[http://failbetterseries.com Fail Better]], a series in development. It's about Tegan, a woman who is so afraid of failure that every decision becomes monumentally difficult during her first lawyer-in-training job at a Toronto law firm. The series follows Tegan in that terrifying feeling of, what if I drop it all?

In _Macbeth's Head_, a comedy by Kyle McDonald, Cleopatra teams up with Maccers & Richard III to make Shakespeare fix their tragic ends.
