..Synopsis
This documentary film features older women (60+) who have gone through wars, displacement, abuse and trauma and have healed through relationship. These women show that we can survive the worst traumas and the most broken systems and thrive if we connect in loving relationships. That is what makes these women resilient. 

"People look, wittingly or unwittingly, consciously or not, for signs of life, sparks of hope, ... they want someone to help them feel safe and worthy enough to lean on and into the other's vitality as they endeavor to make it their own."
- p. 17 of Restoring Resilience by Eileen Russell (Norton 2015)
 
A documentary celebrating resilience in older women. 44 minutes. The thesis is that human beings are designed to heal, and trauma interrupts that design. Secure attachment -a relationship within which someone feels loved, seen and valued- can repair the break and restore the healing design of the human brain and body. Through their stories, these strong, vulnerable women show that  broken attachment systems can heal. That is the amazing thing about being human.
Made in Niagara region, Ontario, with the generous support of the Ontario Arts Council & Essential Collective Theatre. 
An Essential Collective Theatre production, with the City of St. Catharines.
