..Synopsis
This documentary film features older women (60+) who have gone through wars, displacement, abuse and trauma and have healed through relationship. These women show that we can survive the worst traumas and the most broken systems and thrive if we connect in loving relationships. That is what makes these women resilient. 

"People look, wittingly or unwittingly, consciously or not, for signs of life, sparks of hope, ... they want someone to help them feel safe and worthy enough to lean on and into the other's vitality as they endeavor to make it their own."
   p. 17 of Restoring Resilience by Eileen Russell (Norton 2015)
 
A documentary celebrating resilience in older women. 44 minutes. The thesis is that human beings are designed to heal, and trauma interrupts that design. Secure attachment -a relationship within which someone feels loved, seen and valued- can repair the break and restore the healing design of the human brain and body. Through their stories, these strong, vulnerable women show that  broken attachment systems can heal. That is the amazing thing about being human.

//My godmother, Margaret Davidson, experienced violent, sexual abuse, and yet she healed so completely that she modeled forgiveness to me. With her husband of 60 years beside her, she spoke her last words on camera for me, nine days before she died.

//My mother, Dr. Ibtisam Kelada-Sedra, was removed from her home in Alexandria at age 4. She went through displacement and war in Egypt, yet she teaches me how to love.

//Julianne Maslaby lived through her mother's death, father's and brother's suicide. Through her loving relationships, Julianne healed and now helps others as a therapist. 

//Fété Ngira-Batware Kimpiobi lost her mother as a child when she was displaced from the DR Congo. Ethnic war that threatened her family forced her to leave her home. Now, she supports other francophone, black women in white-dominated Niagara. 

//My own trauma forced me to re-evaluate the concept of resilience. What I saw was my mother, my godmother, women who went through trauma and came through it with love. Their loving hearts are the keys to their resilience. My own healing journey helped me see their inspiring resilience. I offer this film to celebrate women who let love shine through their cracks and show that broken people can heal.
