..Synopsis
This documentary film features older women (60+) who have gone through wars, displacement, abuse and trauma and have healed through relationship. These women show that we can survive the worst traumas and the most broken systems and thrive if we connect in loving relationships. That is what makes these women resilient. 

"People look, wittingly or unwittingly, consciously or not, for signs of life, sparks of hope, ... they want someone to help them feel safe and worthy enough to lean on and into the other's vitality as they endeavor to make it their own."
   p. 17 of _Restoring Resilience_ by Eileen Russell (Norton 2015)

A documentary celebrating resilience in older women. 44 minutes. The thesis is that human beings are designed to heal, and trauma interrupts that design. Secure attachment -a relationship within which someone feels loved, seen and valued- can repair the break and restore the healing design of the human brain and body. Through their stories, these strong, vulnerable women show that broken attachment systems can heal. That is the amazing thing about being human.
//My godmother, Margaret Davidson, experienced violent, sexual abuse, and yet she healed so completely that she modeled forgiveness to me. With her husband of 60 years beside her, she spoke her last words on camera for me, nine days before she died.

//My mother, Dr. Ibtisam Kelada-Sedra, was removed from her home in Alexandria at age 4. She went through displacement and war in Egypt, yet she teaches me how to love.

//Julianne Maslabey lived through her mother's death, father's and brother's suicide. Through her loving relationships, Julianne healed and now helps others as a therapist. 

//Fété Ngira-Batware Kimpiobi lost her mother as a child when she was displaced from the DR Congo. Ethnic war that threatened her family forced her to leave her home. Now, she supports other francophone, black women in white-dominated Niagara. 

My own trauma forced me to re-evaluate the concept of resilience. What I saw was my mother, my godmother, women who went through trauma and came through it with love. Their loving hearts are the keys to their resilience. I offer this film to celebrate women who let love shine through their cracks and show that broken people can heal.

..TV development
//On the TV development side, Roselyn is creating strong, complex female leads in her series, _Fail Better_. And she is thankful to the crew and actors who helped her to make a proof of concept for it. 
_Fail Better_ is an episodic dramedy following Tegan, an articling student with a crippling fear of failure, that drives her through a cutthroat apprenticeship in a Mississauga law firm. We are actively seeking a development partner. 
//It's about Tegan, a woman who is so afraid of failure that every decision becomes monumentally difficult during her first lawyer-in-training job at a Toronto law firm. The series follows Tegan in that terrifying feeling of, what if I drop it all? 
//Trailer is live now! Check in [[https://www.facebook.com/FailBetter/ on the "Fail Better" facebook page]] for updates.
